$./configure
$make
$./src/raytracer -i /path/to/scenefile

The output and depth will be in the current directory
the default output file will be "output.ppm"
and default depth  file will be "depth.pgm"

This program has been test under Gentoo linux 2012 with gcc 4.5.3 and Mac os x
10.7 with g++ and clang++(actually not fully tested under this condition)

Reference
The initial math.hpp is from Jacco Bikker www.bik5.com.
And the ray sphere intersect code is adapt from his code.

FAQ:
1. The output file may not have desired format.
If the Graphicmagick does not support the format, it will output a miff(
Magick image file format) file.

2. If there still some thing wrong with the program, try using minimal set.
At configure time, try using --disable-gm and --disable-openmp.
$configure --disable-gm --disable-openmp
